In this project, I have created several simple scripts related to shell variables, expansions and init files:

0. Create alias ls with value rm *
1. Print hello user, where user is current Linux user
2. Add /action to PATH where /action is last directory shell looks into when looking for a program
3. Count number of directories in PATH
4. List environmental variables
5. List all local and environmental variables and functions
6. Create new local variable 'BETTY' with value 'Holberton'
7. Create new global variable 'HOLBERTON' with value 'Betty'
8. Print sum of 128 and value stored in environmental variable 'TRUEKNOWLEDGE'
9. Print result of 'POWER' divided by 'DIVIDE'
10. Print result of 'BREATH' to the power of 'LOVE'
11. Convert base 2 number 'BINARY' to base 10
12. Print all possible combinations of two letters, except oo
13. Print a number with two decimal places
14. Convert base 10 number 'DECIMAL' to base 16


Additionally, the project contains two blog posts hosted at medium.com :

15. What happens when you type ls *.c?
16. What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link?
